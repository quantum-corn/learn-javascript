What it does is use 16 bit data for the most common characters but for the rare ones, two such sets. This is a bad idea.\n",
    "> There is a lack of consistency. JS was already written to work on using a 16-bit character code to handle strings. Some features broke, down for the characters involving double code such are some Chinese and emojis. See example.\n",
