This is a collection of my notes and codes while I learn JS.

Things to know:

- I was not absolutely new to programming when I started.
- The book directory refers to the book Eloquent JavaScript - greatly recommended.
- I wrote the notes for myself. But I kept in mind that someone else could perhaps use it. So the notes are explanatory.
  - I practically skipped over ch 1-3, the notes are a little more detailed starting ch 4.
  - There are exercise solutions. Use your discretion in accessing that.
  - Feel free to suggest edits or contribute. I'd appreciate it.
- There might be knowledge in the chapter notes, gathered from outside sources.
